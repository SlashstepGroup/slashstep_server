# Slashstep Server contribution guide
## Issues
Before starting work, make sure there is a GitHub issue for your change.

## Tests
All tests must pass before merging a change into the [`main`](https://github.com/SlashstepGroup/slashstep_server/tree/main) branch. You can use `cargo test` to ensure that the tests pass on your machine prior to making a pull request.
